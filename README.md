# NoteStop
### Project Made By Team Creedorian For KU HackFest 2022


NoteStop is a notes and study material sharing platform for the youngsters who are always stuck with the one provided just by their own faculties and yet unable to understand the concepts and are eager to know more and more but are bounded by the lack of proper access to the resources and platforms

## Features

- User can add new college  and start notes/study material.
- All the notes are provided by the peer and any number of users can share the notes
 without any bounds
- high ranking writers get some extra privilledges 

## Tech

Notestop uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJs] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Numerous NodeJs Packages] - for implementing various features 
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Anserd itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

NoteStop requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd Ku-Hacks-Submission
npm i
nodemon app.js
```
